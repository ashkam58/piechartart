# Visual Stats Lab (React + Vite)

A classroom-ready mini-site for teaching **pie charts, bar charts / histograms, stem-and-leaf diagrams, grouped frequency tables** and **population pyramids** with interactive tools, games, and image-based practice.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the printed localhost URL in your browser.

## Pages
- **/theory** – crisp notes, formulas, heuristics, and memory hooks.
- **/interactive** – build charts from custom data (live angles, percents, grouped mean, etc.).
- **/games** – quick-fire angle challenge.
- **/questions** – the screenshots you shared as practice prompts (already embedded in `/public/images`).

## Tech
- React 18 + Vite
- TailwindCSS (utility styling)
- Recharts (charts)
- Framer Motion (micro-animations)
- React Router

## Tip
Use this as a foundation. You can add more games (mode/median speed-run, histogram hunt) and pre-load exam-style datasets for one-click demos.
